<h1 class="topictitle1">The Music Specialization</h1>
<div><p>The music specialization is a set of sample files that demonstrates
how to create a new specialization plugin. It should be placed in the demo/
directory inside the DITA Open Toolkit. This version has been updated for
DITA-OT version 1.4, to remove calls to deprecated code.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Purpose</h2><p>This specialization allows authors to document
their musical tastes and collections. It is intended primarily as a sample
to demonstrate various aspects of a specialization plugin for DITA.</p>
<p>The
specialization creates a new topic type with a root element of musicCollection.
This topic type is based on the DITA Reference topic type, which is part of
the OASIS DITA standard. Within the musicCollection element, authors may enter
the usual title and short description, followed by a special body created
for this type. The contents of musicBody are limited to a CD list, section,
and the familiar simpletable element. The body could have been limited to
only the CD table, but the section is included so that authors may provide
additional information about their music, such as longer commentary about
one set of CDs. The simpletable element is kept in case additional reference
information is desired that does not fit into the strictly controlled CD list.</p>
<p>The
CD list element is the focus of this specialization. It is based on a properties
table from the reference specialization. Like that table, it has an optional
set of headers; if no headers are included, a default set of generated headers
is used in the output. Each row of this table has three columns. The first
column takes a band name; the second contains one or more album name; and
the third column contains any comments about the band or albums.</p>
<p>This
plugin comes with a DTD implementation, documentation, sample files, and XSLT
overrides that create generated headings for each music topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">How to use this with the DITA Open Toolkit</h2><p>Unzip
music.zip into the demo directory. Then run a build using the default toolkit
builds (using the supplied ANT files, or the Javaâ„¢ command line). Each of these calls
the plugin integrator, which will install the plugin files; this will happen
regardless of whether the files you build make use of this plugin.</p>
<p>To
build files with the specialization, you have several simple options. First,
ensure that your environment variables are set up properly (remember that
the toolkit requires things like the CLASSPATH and ANT_HOME variables). Then,
try any of these:</p>
<ul><li>Use your normal build process, with the sample music map as your input
file.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and go into the main toolkit directory. Run this
command: <pre><kbd class="userinput">ant -f demo/music/run-sample.xml</kbd></pre>
The
XHTML output files will be generated in the directory <tt class="sysout">demo/music/out</tt>.</li>
<li>From the main toolkit directory, use this command line:<pre><kbd class="userinput">java -jar lib/dost.jar /i:demo/music/sample/music.ditamap /transtype:xhtml /outdir:demo/music/out</kbd></pre>
</li>
<li>Use the prompted ant demo build. After running the command <kbd class="userinput">ant
-f build_demo.xml</kbd> in the main toolkit directory, enter the input
file name <kbd class="userinput">demo/music/sample/music.ditamap</kbd>; then set
other options as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've discovered how easy it is to write with the music specialization,
you can create new music topics, and mix them in to all of your other content.
Point any of your maps at a music topic, and it will build just like all of
your other topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Plugin organization</h2><p>The plugin is organized into
several directories, which mirror the organization of the toolkit itself.
Other specializations should follow this same organization.</p>
<ul><li>The root directory must contain at least two files. The file catalog-dita.xml
is required in order to add your DTD files to the main catalog. The file plugin.xml
is required (with this name) in order for the toolkit to recognize your plugin;
it also tells the toolkit where to find important files within the plugin.
The ANT build file is a good idea, if you wish to provide an easy way to build
any sample files; the included file run-sample.xml generates XHTML from the
samples.</li>
<li>The docs/ directory contains all documentation for new elements in the
music specialization. There is no requirement for how to organize the files
within this directory; however, it is easy to separate them into a source
directory and an output directory. Each output format could get its own directory
(this plugin includes a win/ directory for the compiled HTML Help output).</li>
<li>The dtd/ directory contains all DTD related files for this specialization.</li>
<li>The epic/ directory is used by one tool that imbeds the toolkit, and can
be ignored by most users. Other applications that use overrides for the music
specialization could store them in similar directories.</li>
<li>The sample/ directory contains sample topics that use the music specialization.</li>
<li>There is not yet a schema implementation of the music specialization;
if one existed, it would be in the schema directory.</li>
<li>The xsl/ directory contains all XSL files used by this specialization.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Using this plugin as a template</h2><div class="p">This plugin can
easily be used as a template to create your own specialization plugins. Here
are the files you will need to change to create your own plugin:<ol><li>In the plugin.xml file, change the plugin.xml file so that it extends
all of the tasks you expect to extend.</li>
<li>In the catalog-dita.xml file, replace the music values with your new DTD
files.</li>
<li>In the file run-sample.xml, replace any references to music with your
own specialization, and replace the music input file and output directory
with your own samples.</li>
<li>In the DTD directory, replace the music DTDs with your own specialization.
If you wish, you can rename them and use them as a model for your own specialization.
They are based off of reference, so they will be most easily used as a template
for a different reference specialization.</li>
<li>If there is a schema implementation, store it in the schema directory.</li>
<li>Replace the sample files with your own samples.</li>
<li>In the XSL directory, remove the music overrides, or modify them to match
elements from your own specialization. Remember that the XSLT templates should <strong>only</strong> match
elements from your specialization, and should be ignored for any other topic
type. For example, to override the related links within a music topic, I should
match a related-links element <em>within</em> a music topic, not just any related-links
element. This will allow your topic types and processing to mix with other
topic types and their processing. Here is an example of how to match related-links
within a specific topic type:<pre>&lt;xsl:template match="*[contains(@class,' musicCollection/musicCollection ')]//
                     *[contains(@class,' topic/related-links ')]"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Create special processing for links within a music topic --&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>Files that enable the music specialization for a specific application
should be stored in a directory specific to that application, such as the
epic directory in this plugin.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Items of interest</h2><p>This specialization include elements
that produce new generated text. In order for this to work, the generated
text must be shipped as part of the plugin. These files are included within
the xsl/ directory. Each language is placed in an individual file, and one
lookup file allows processes to determine what languages are available. Within
the XSL files, there is a local template called musicGetString, which in turn
calls the standard getString template. The difference is that it passes an
extra parameter, which allows the default template to find translations for
the new strings. The musicGetString template is shown here:</p>
<pre>&lt;xsl:template name="musicGetString"&gt;
   &lt;xsl:param name="stringName"/&gt;
   &lt;xsl:call-template name="getString"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="stringFileList"&gt;../../demo/music/xsl/musicstrings.xml&lt;/xsl:with-param&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="stringName" select="$stringName"/&gt;
   &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
<p>The stringFileList parameter must be a relative path from the file
that contains the common template, back to the plugin file that lists available
languages.</p>
<p>If the override needs to use generated text from the standard
transform code, such as the word Note, then it should call the normal getString
template without any extra parameters.</p>
