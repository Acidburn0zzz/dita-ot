<h1 class="topictitle1">XSL directory information</h1>
<div><p>The files in the XSL directory are primarily used for generating
output from DITA topics that use the Music specialization. The directory should
contain any XSLT and associated files used for overriding existing transforms,
or used for new transforms. There is no requirement on file organization within
the xsl/ directory.</p>
<div class="section"><p>The following files are included in this directory:</p>
<ul><li>music2xhtml.xsl: This is an override for XHTML output. It generates headers
for the music table, and adds a heading before each table of CDs. Most content
falls back to default DITA processing; the only reason for the length of this
override is the complexity of the original table code that must be overridden.</li>
<li>musicstrings.xml: This file informs output transforms what languages are
available for generated text, and where to find each language.</li>
<li>music-en-us.xml: English translations of generated text.</li>
<li>music-ru-ru.xml: Russian translations of generated text.</li>
<li>music-sv-se.xml: Swedish translations of generated text.</li>
<li>music2id.xsl: Unusable in the toolkit at present, this is an XSLT file
that overrides a conversion from DITA into the IBMIDDoc SGML DTD.</li>
<li>itune2dit.xsl: an early attempt to place my entire music library into
a DITA specialization (the DTD for that specialization is lost in the mists
of time, though it may be resurrected later).</li>
<li>library2xhtml.xsl: XSL code that would convert said library into XHTML,
with special header information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">XSL Files for new plugins</h2><p>If a new specialization
does not change any output behavior, then there is no need for an XSL directory
or for XSLT overrides.</p>
<p>If a file does change output behavior, then each
generated format will likely need an override template. This plugin includes
one for XHTML, which overrides the CD List table to create generated text.</p>
<div class="p">If
a file creates generated text, then several additional files are required: <ul><li>A strings file similar to the musicstrings.xml file in this directory.
This file is used to determine which languages are available, and to determine
the file name for each language.</li>
<li>Each language should be stored in an XML file. For example, this plugin
includes files for English, Russian, and Swedish. By convention, these files
all use the same name, apart from a standard language code based on acceptable
DITA language values (acceptable values are explained in the DITA specification;
the values are taken from an external definition used for many XML languages).</li>
