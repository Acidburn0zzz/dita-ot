<title>DITA-OT pre-processing architecture</title>
<shortdesc>This topic describes the set of steps commonly known as
the pre-processing stage of a DITA build. These steps typically run
at the start of any build using the DITA-OT, regardless of the final
output format.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p>Each step described corresponds to one Ant target in the build
pipeline. The general Ant target "preprocess" will call all of the
targets described here.</p>
