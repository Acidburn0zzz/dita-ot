<title>Conref push (conrefpush)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>conrefpush</codeph> step resolves "conref push"
references. The conref push feature was added in the DITA 1.2 specification,
and the associated processing is available in DITA-OT version 1.5
and later. This step only processes documents that use conref push
(or that are updated due to the push action). The step is implemented
in Java.</shortdesc><?Pub Caret -1?>
