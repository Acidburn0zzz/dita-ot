<title>Resolve keyref (keyref)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>keyref</codeph> step examines all keys defined
in the source material, and updates key references appropriately.
Links that make use of keys are updated so that any href value is
replaced by the appropriate target; key based text replacement is
also evaluated. The keyref mechanism was defined as part of the DITA
1.2 standard, and is available in DITA-OT 1.5 and later.</shortdesc>
